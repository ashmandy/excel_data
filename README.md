## Pupose: This project demonstrates technical proficiency in Microsoft Excel through a set of tasks that includes data formatting, sorting, filtering, formula construction, pivot tables, and chart creation. It simulates real world data preparation and analysis tasks using public datasets.

## Skills Demonstrated: 

- Table formatting and data validation
- Conditional formatting
- Sorting and multi-level filtering
- Cross-sheet formulas and functions ( VLOOKUP, COUNTA..)
- Pivot table creation and configuration
- Custom charting and data visualization
- Professional print/page setup and documentation

 ##  Key Worksheets Overview:
 
**01–US Census Data**: Structured and formatted census data using Excel Tables, data validation, freeze panes, and customized print layout.
- **02–Conditional Formatting**: Applied conditional formatting to highlight values below 1789 in column G with red fill and text.
- **03–Hide Column**: Hid unnecessary columns (B and F) to enhance data clarity and focus.
- **05–Summary**: Synthesized cross-sheet data using formulas to calculate earliest foundation dates, total counties, and Navy program counts.
- **06–Calendars & 07–Fall 2020 Class Schedule**: Automated class schedule population using VLOOKUP with an external calendar lookup table.
- **08–Single Level Sort**: Ranked county-level data by 2010 population estimates in ascending order.
- **09–Two Level Sort**: Ordered championship data by German Champion (descending) and Level (ascending).
- **10–12 Filtering Worksheets**: Filtered complex datasets using numeric, conditional, and color filters to isolate top values, historic builds, and migration trends.
- **13–14 Pivot Table Report**: Built and configured a pivot table to summarize government property data with field filters and slicers.
- **15–Food Demand**: Visualized Sub-Saharan grain demand and production with a clustered bar chart; customized titles and axes for clarity.
- **16–Veterans**: Designed a stacked bar chart to compare veteran demographics by state; highlighted key values and applied a custom legend.

## Real Work Application:

**Data cleaning**: Processed 3,000+ rows of cencus data and formatted it for structured analysis.
**Data Validation**: Applied filters, constraints, and lookups to simulate quality control steps in business or government datasets.
**Data Storytelling**: Translated raw data into clean visuals and summries ready for presentation.
## What I Learned: 

This project my expanded my skills in Excel as a tool for structured data analysis. I applied real world techniques like pivot tables and multiplelevel filtering to explore large datasets and used lookup functions and conditional formatting to spotlight meanungful patterns. By customizing print layouts, headers, and charts i also learned how to present data cleanly to non-technical audiences.
